## 💫 About Me:
I’m a MERN Stack Developer who enjoys building real-world, impactful web applications. I work mainly with React on the frontend and Node.js/MongoDB on the backend, focusing on clean code, good structure, and smooth user experiences.

I’m constantly improving my skills through hands-on projects, learning new tools, and exploring best practices in modern web development. I love solving problems, understanding how things work under the hood, and turning ideas into usable products.

• Expertise: MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), Next.js
• Career Achievements: Completed 10+ Full Stack projects, including e-commerce platforms, dashboards, and full-stack apps.

My goal is simple:
build applications that are fast, user-friendly, and meaningful.
